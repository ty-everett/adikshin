<h1>ADIKSHIN!</h1>
<p>What would you do if you had <b>NO INTERNET</b> for 3 days? Stare hopelessly at the Google Chrome offline jumpy dinosaur page?<br/>
That's what I did, until I decided to make my own game, ADIKSHIN!</p>
<p>ADIKSHIN is a play on the word "adiction" spelled incorrectly in an effort to defeat the Grammar Nazis.</p>
<p>It's a game where you're this lonely square, and your only purpose in life is to jump over a bunch of other squares in order to get
as much "jump munnies" as possible. You can then go to a store, and buy things like ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺ for insane amounts of this ever-elusive
currency. You can even save your progress until the next time you get DDoS'ed or just want to have some fun.</p>
<h2>FEATURES</h2>

<h2>TODO:</h2>
<p>Better physics</p>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>While I acknoeledge that this is not one of my most professional endevors into coding, it did teach me a lot about the hava language 
and programming in general, so I decided to upload it here anyways.</p>
